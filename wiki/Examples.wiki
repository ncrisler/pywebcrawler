== Custom Journal ==
If customization is required, modifying the Journal object (or creating an object with the same methods) is the way. Here is some basic examples of how the Journal can be re-written to fit your purpose.

==== Only crawl a single domain ====
{{{
from pywebcrawler import WebCrawler, Journal, getDomainName

class CustomJournal(Journal):
    def addUrl(self, url, referer):
        if getDomainName(url) == 'the-domain-i-want-crawled.com':
            Journal.addUrl(self, url, referer)

journal = CustomJournal()
journal.addUrl('http://www.the-domain-i-want-crawled.com/')
crawler = WebCrawler(journal)

try:
    crawler.start()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    crawler.stop()
