# Python Web Crawler #
**pywebcrawler** is a simple, lightweight and yet effective web-crawler API written entirely in Python, which aims to ease customization of crawling and data-fetching.

Via a [Journal-object](http://code.google.com/p/pywebcrawler/wiki/Journal) you define what URLs to crawl and what to do with the pages once they've been downloaded. Interacting with the crawler through Request and Response objects makes it easy to handle any situation where, for example, HTTP authentication or cookie support is needed.

**pywebcrawler is of May 2010 still being developed and tested. Source is not yet available.**

## Dependencies ##
Besides standard modules, pywebcrawler depends only on the [lxml module](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) for parsing HTML.

## Documentation ##
Some (a little poor) documentation is available in [the Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/pywebcrawler/w/list).

## Examples ##
Examples of how to customize and use the crawler can be [found here](http://code.google.com/p/pywebcrawler/wiki/Examples).
